He motions for you to sit down across from him, tilts back a local brew. Then he leans across the table, and his voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper, "How would you like to be a part of something big? I mean, real big. Known universe big. Changing worlds kind of stuff."]]
   text[2] = [["But man, I am getting ahead of myself. My name is Samzer, Samzer Tehran. I work for Tru-pulse. You may have heard of us." He pulls up the badge from his chest. A similarly disheveled picture of Samzer stares out of it, right over the words 'Press Correspondent' and a Tru-pulse logo. 
"We are an independent journalistic outfit dedicated to finding and spreading the Truth, whatever it may be." Tru-pulse. It rings a bell. You've heard other spacers mention it countless bars, some kind of multimedia tabloid that's notorious for its far-fetched 'news' stories and tall tales. You wonder if you should really get involved in this kind of thing...]]
   text[3] = [[You nod back at Samzer, and ask him what story he's working on right now.
"Aliens." He says simply, leaning back and taking another sip of his bottle. 
"Rumor has it that there have been multiple UFO sightings in the %s system. So far the Empire's kept this very hush hush. Good news is that gives us a chance to break this story before anyone else scoops it. But I can't do it by myself. I need a captain, someone with the cajones to risk life and limb to venture out into the unknown and bring the truth back to the people! Are you that captain?"]]
   text[4] = [["I knew it was you, from the moment I laid eyes on you! I told myself, Samzer, now here is a fellow truthseeker, a hardcore adventurer just itching to make a difference!" He rubs his hands together, grinning. "Here's the job; you take me to the %s system, and we go UFO hunting. From what I've heard, they shouldn't be too hard to find. We get close enough for me to get some good holo-shots, and then fly to Arcturus to broadcast the story from Tru-pulse HQ. Let's rock and roll!" He gets up from the table, and bounds happily towards the docking bay.]]
   
   text[5] = [[Samzer comes up to the cockpit with you, opening a mobile monitor on his lap. He points to a dot on your sensors, happily ignoring the flashing HOSTILE' indicators. "There! Get in as close as you can! I need you to stay close to the UFO for at least three seconds so I can get some good shots!"]]
   text[6] = "Shooting holo321Complete!"
   
   text[9] = [["Man! That was something, wasn't it!" Samzer says as he rolls his holo-recording equipment off your ship. You eye the scorch marks on your hull from the strange ship's weapons, but refrain from yelling. "The public is gonna go nuts over this! We've gotta get it out on the Pulse right away!" He start to dart away. You clear your throat loudly to remind Samzer that he's forgetting something. He turns around then slaps himself on the forehead. "Oh yeah! Your credits! My bad, here you go." He hands you a credit chip for 10,000 credits. "I know it's not much, but it's the best we can do. But hey, if you ever want to help us uncover the truth in the future, look for me here. We can always use a good pilot!"]]
