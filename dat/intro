   Humans have always looked up at the skies at night, dreaming of venturing among the stars.

   While for many centuries this was an improbability, the scientific community soldiered on. Beginning with unmanned suborbital flights, the  prospect of humans colonizing the galaxy grew brighter. Following this, manned space flights were performed, culminating in the establishment of colonies on planets and moons within the Sol system. However, given that none of these bodies supported life naturally, these colonies required frequent supplies from Earth to sustain themselves.

   In time, habitable planets were discovered within several light years of Earth, a definite possibility for the future of humanity. Hulking colony ships were constructed, housing thousands of volunteers, and they were sent into the void to colonize four new worlds.

   Outfitted with the best in terraforming and colonization equipment available at the time, the new colonies nevertheless got off to a slow start. Many years passed as the new human worlds tried to establish themselves. The void of space meant only extremely sporadic contact with the home world, and no resupplies or reinforcements.

   Earth, meanwhile, continued to develop scientifically. Research focused on dealing with the massive distances between worlds, in hopes that the existing colonies could one day be better reached and their wealth, if any, harvested. Over the years, many faster-than-light theories were formulated, tested, found unwholesome and discarded. Then, one day, one experiment succeeded.

   A way was found to send objects from one point in space to another almost instantly. The object passed through a hitherto unknown medium that came to be called hyperspace, experiencing no apparent side effects from the journey. It seemed that this mode of travel was fit for human use.

   News of this discovery spread across the Sol system, and within months functional hyperspace drives were being brought to market in purpose-built ships. Humanity expanded at breakneck speeds, travelling in days what would have taken months or years with sub-light propulsion.

   Humanity spread in a relative blink of an eye. New worlds were found and settled in what came to be known as the Second Growth. Advanced techniques and a real supply route from Earth meant that the new generation of colonies were orders of magnitude more successful than the old ones, which by now had become all but obsolete.

   After a short time of frontier spirit and prosperity, the situation began to degrade. Tensions eventually led to a galactic-scale war, which raged for over a century. It ended only when a man named Daedris seized power over most of the human worlds, founding a new Empire and establishing himself as the first Galactic Emperor in human history.

   Relations were mended, trade routes were reopened and protected by the iron fist of the Empire military. Technological development advanced at unprecedented speeds, allowing for the decontamination of many irradiated worlds. Truly, humanity was at its zenith. Historians would call this period the Imperial Golden Age.

   It would not last. The Empire grew older, and its grip on the galaxy waned. The successors to Emperor Daedris would prove to be less noble than he, and over time the Empire's fist grew to be an open palm. Discontent among the workers, religious influences from the outer regions of the realm and grand projects with results other than those intended forced the Empire to subdivide into Great Houses, ceding much of its direct control to others.

   Yet it paled in comparison to the events that followed, which would come to be referred to as the Incident. A cataclysmic explosion shook the galaxy, and the heart of the Empire went silent. Unknown in cause, unprecedented in scale, an explosion rippled outwards from humanity's birthplace, annihilating all in its path, leaving a dense nebula in place of dozens of systems.

   That was more than 10 SCU ago. You find yourself in a universe with a decaying Empire, where corruption and piracy run rampant, rattled to its core by the Incident. But where there is chaos, there is also opportunity.


   Welcome to the universe of Naev...
